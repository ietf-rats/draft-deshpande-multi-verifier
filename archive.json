It just receives Additional MetaData (alongside Evidence) in a CMW, which is propagated down the chain.

If in absence of this knowledge, will not be possible to decode the CE.\n\nIt doesn't look like a necessity to me.\n\nYou can imagine a CMW (or equivalent wrapper) where each evidence entry in the logical collection has a label that maps unambiguously to a specific \"attestation scheme\" (to use a Veraison term.)\n\nWhat each node in the Verifiers' chain needs to understand is which label to \"de-reference\" to obtain the \"component Evidence\" that it knows how to process.  Once that is done it can replace that label with an equivalent label in the \"AR bucket\" and attach the corresponding AR.\n\nSuch a verifier can be totally blind to all other labels it doesn't know about, i.e., it can completely ignore the global topology and only do its local work.\n\n",

      "body": "Please change the name of the draft to a more meaningful one. As someone who has attended the older presentation with the similar title [3] in Dublin, I found it very confusing to see why the story has suddenly changed from load-balancing/single point of failure to functionality-based verifiers.\n\nAnyway, I am not convinced of the use cases presented in multi-verifiers presentation [0] at interim meeting. Some comments/questions below\n\n**Comment on slide 6: containers:**\n\nThe split of verifiers is just an implementation decision. See Sec. III.D.2) in the paper [1]. This is exactly the same as your use case with s/Realm Verifier/Workload Verifier. In my understanding, security should remain whether you have split or separate verifiers. Please give me a very strong motivation on why this needs architectural changes.\n\n**Questions on slide 7: Confidential training use case:**\nI read through the mentioned reference [2] and again this is just an implementation decision. I am not convinced that this needs an architectural change either. Intel sees both Evidences in your case and I don't see any privacy benefit. What is the real benefit of this implementation compared to Intel Trust Authority just fetching the Reference Values and Endorsements from NVIDIA?\nAlso, I have some general questions to understand your real motivation behind presenting this use case:\n\n- Who is the Relying Party here: model owner or data owner?\n- Is AI model and AI application the same?\n- There are so many arrows going here and there. Could you very briefly tell the sequence of those?\n- Could you give me a concrete example of a policy that only NVIDIA can apply and that Intel Trust Authority cannot apply?\n \nThe slide mentions \"Source: Confidential mesh computing (MarbleRun)\" but the hyperlink is broken. Could you share the link and explain how that is relevant?\n\n\n**Editorial comments on draft:**\n\n- Draft is using the terms \"Composite Attester\" and  \"Component Attesters\" before they are defined. \n- I don't see any of the use cases mentioned in the draft. Please add clear explanation of use cases in the draft for the readers to understand the motivation of this work.\n\n\n[0] https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/interim-2025-rats-01/materials/slides-interim-2025-rats-01-sessa-ietf-rats-interim-multiverifier-00.pdf\n[1] https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10373038\n[2] https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Products-and-Solutions/Security/Seamless-Attestation-of-Intel-TDX-and-NVIDIA-H100-TEEs-with/post/1525587\n\n[3] https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/121/materials/slides-121-rats-handling-multiple-verifiers-in-rats-architecture-01.pdf\n",
