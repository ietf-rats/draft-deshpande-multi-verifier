It just receives Additional MetaData (alongside Evidence) in a CMW, which is propagated down the chain.

Once that is done it can replace that label with an equivalent label in the \"AR bucket\" and attach the corresponding AR.\n\nSuch a verifier can be totally blind to all other labels it doesn't know about, i.e., it can completely ignore the global topology and only do its local work.\n\n",

I can add a alternative statement that can address your point but largely the entire blob (of Composite Evidence) still flows (whether in a CMW Blob) or whatever.!
