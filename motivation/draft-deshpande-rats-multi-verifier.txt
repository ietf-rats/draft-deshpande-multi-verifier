Abstract

   IETF RATS Architecture, defines the key role of a Verifier.  In a
   complex system, this role needs to be performed by multiple Verfiers
   coordinating together to assess the full trustworthiness of an
   Attester.  This document focuses on various topological patterns for
   a multiple Verifier system.

1.  Introduction

   A Verifier plays a central role in any Remote Attestation System.  A
   Verifier appraises the Attester and produces Attestation Results,
   which are essentially a verdict of attestation.  The results are
   consumed by the Relying Party to conclude the trustworthiness of the
   Attester, before making any critical decisions about the Attester,
   such as admitting it to the network or releasing confidential
   resources to it.  Attesters can come in wide varieties of shape and
   form.  For example Attesters can be endpoints (edge or IoT devices)
   or complex machines in the cloud.  Composite Attester Section 3.1,
   generate Evidence that consists of multiple parts.  For example, in
   data center servers, it is not uncommon for separate attesting
   environments (AE) to serve a subsection of the entire machine.  One
   AE might measure and attest to what was booted on the main CPU, while
   another AE might measure and attest to what was booted machine's GPU.
   Throughout this document we use the term Component Attester
   Section 3.1 to address the sub-entity or an individual layer which
   produces its own Evidence in a Composite Attester system.

   In a Composite Attester system, it may not be possible for a single
   Verifier to possess all the capabilities or information required to
   conduct a complete appraisal of the Attester.  Please refer to
   Section 2 for motivation of this document.  Multiple Verifiers need
   to collaborate to reach a conclusion on the appraisal and produce the
   Attestation Results.

   This document describes various topological patterns of multiple
   Verifiers that work in a coordinated manner to conduct appraisal of a
   Composite Attester to produce an Attestation Results.

2.  Need for Multiple Verifiers

   To conduct the task of Evidence appraisal, a Verifier requires: 1.
   Reference Values from trusted supply chain actors producing,
   aggregating, or administering Attesters (Reference Value Providers)
   2.  Endorsements from trusted supply chain actors producing,
   certifying, or compliance checking Attesters (Endorsers) 3.
   Appraisal Policy for Evidence, which is under the control of the
   Verifier Owner

   The Verifier inputs listed above are linked to the shape of the
   Attesters.  Typically, Composite Attesters come with a varying degree
   of heterogeneity of Evidence formats, depending on the type of
   Attesting Environments that come with each Component Attester, for
   example, CPU variants or GPU/FPGA variants.  When conducting Evidence
   appraisal for a Composite Attester, the following challenges remain:

   1.  An Attester's composition can change over time based on market
       dynamics and availability (e.g., a set of racks in a data center
       gets thousands of new FPGAs).  It is highly unlikely that there
       is always one appropriate Verifier that satisfies all the
       requirements that a complex and changing Composite Attesters
       imposes.  It may not be economically viable to build and maintain
       such a degree of complexity in a single Verifier.

   2.  A Verifier Owner may have an Appraisal Policy for Evidence of a
       Component Attester that is internal to them and which they may
       choose not to reveal to a â€œmonolithic" Verifier.

   3.  A Reference Values Provider may not wish to reveal its Reference
       Values or their lifecycle to a monolithic Verifier.

   4.  There may not be a single actor in the ecosystem that can stand
       up and take ownership of verifying every Component Attester due
       to a lack of knowledge, complexity, regulations or associated
       cost.

   5.  The mix today is a combination of Verifier services provided by
       component manufacturers, Verifiers provided by integrators, and
       Verifiers under local authority (i.e., close to the attester).
       Rarely is it just one of these.

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses terms and concepts defined by the RATS
   architecture.  For a complete glossary, see Section 4 of [RFC9334].

   Specifically this document heavily uses the terms Layered Attester
   Section 3.2 of [RFC9334] and Composite Device Section 3.3 of
   [RFC9334]

3.1.  Glossary

   This document uses the following terms:

   Composite Attester:  A Composite Attester is either a Composite
      Device or a Layered Attester or any composition involving a
      combination of one or more Composite Devices or Layered Attesters.

   Component Attester:  A Component Attester is a single Attester of a
      Composite Attester.  For this document, a Component Attester is an
      entity which produces a single Evidence which can be appraised by
      a Verifier.

   Composite Evidence:  Evidence produced by a Composite Attester.

   Lead Verifier:  A Verifier which acts as a Main Verifier to receive
      Composite Evidence from a Composite Attester.

   Aggregated Attestation Results:  An Aggregated Attestation Results
      (AAR) refers to a collection of Attestation Results produced upon
      completion of appraisal of a Composite Attester.

4.  Multi Verifier topological patterns

   A Composite Attester has multiple Component Attesters.  Each Attester
   requires a different set of Verifiers.  Hence multiple Verifiers
   collaborate to appraise a Composite Attester.

                                  +----------+

   The following sub-sections describe the various roles that exist in
   this pattern.

4.1.1.  Lead Verifier

   In this topological pattern, there is an Entity known as Lead
   Verifier.

   Lead Verifier is the central entity in communication with the
   Attester (directly in passport model or indirectly via the Relying
   Party in background-check model).  It receives Attestation Evidence
   from a Composite Attester.  If the Composite Attestation Evidence is
   signed, then it validates the integrity of the Evidence by validating
   the signature.  If signature verification fails, the Verification is
   terminated.  Otherwise it performs the following steps.

   *  Lead Verifier has the knowledge about the overall structure of the
      Composite Evidence.  It decodes the Composite Evidence to extract
      the Component Attester Evidence.  This may lead to "N" Evidence,
      one for each Component Attester.

   *  Lead Verifier delegates each Component Attester Evidence to their
      own Verifier and receives Component Attester Attestation Results
      after successful Appraisal of Evidence.

   *  Once the Lead Verifier receives Attestation Results from all the
      Verifiers, it combines the results from each Verifier to construct
      a Aggregated Attestation Results (AAR).  The Lead verifier may
      apply its own policies and also add extra claims as part of its
      appraisal.

   *  Lead Verifier conveys the AAR to the Attester (in Passport model)
      or to the Relying Party (in background check model).

   The overall verdict may be dependent on the Appraisal Policy of the
   Lead Verifier.

   In certain topologies, it is possible that only the Composite
   Evidence is signed to provide the overall integrity, while the
   individual Component Attester Evidence (example Evidence 1) is not
   protected.  In such cases, the Lead Verifer upon processing of
   Composite Evidence may wrap the Component Attester Evidence (example
   Evidence 1) in a signed Conceptual Message Wrapper (CMW), and send it
   to each Verifier (example Verifier 1).

4.1.2.  Verifier for Component Attester

   The role of a Component Attester Verifier is to receive Component
   Attester Evidence from the lead Verifier and produce Attestation
   Results to the Lead Verifier.

4.1.3.  Trust Relationships

   In this topology the Lead Verifier is fully trusted by Component
   Attester Verifiers (example Verifier 1).

   Also, each of the Component Attester Verifier is fully trusted by the
   Lead Verifier.  Lead Verifier is provisioned with the Trust Anchors
   for Verifier 1..N.

4.2.  Cascaded Pattern {: #sec-verifier-cascade }

   Figure below shows the block diagram of a Cascaded Pattern.

                               +-----------+          +-----------+             +-----------+
+--------+                     |           |          |           |             |           |
|        |  Composite Evidence |           |  (CE)    |           |   (CE)      |           |
|        +-------------------->+           +--------->+           +------------>+           |
|        |     (CE)            |           |Partial AR|           | Partial AR  |           |
|Attester|                     | Verifier 1|          | Verifier 2|             | Verifier N|
|  or    |  Aggregated         |           |          |           |             |           |
| RP     +<--------------------+           +<---------+           +<------------+           |
+--------+ Attestation Results |           |  (AAR)   |           |  (AAR)      |           |
              (AAR)            |           |          |           |             |           |
                               +-----------+          +-----------+             +-----------+

   In this topological pattern, the Attestation Verification happens in
   sequence.  Verifiers are cascaded to perform the Attestation
   Appraisal.  Each Verifier in the chain possess the knowledge of the
   entire Composite Attester topology.

   Attester may send the Composite Evidence(CE) to any of the Verifier
   (directly in the passport model, or indirectly via the Relying Party
   in the background-check model).  The Verifier which processes the
   Composite Evidence, Verifies the signature on the Evidence, if
   present.  It decodes the Composite Evidence performs Appraisal of the
   Component Attester whose Reference Values and Endorsements are in its
   database.  Once the appraisal is complete, it forwards the Composite
   Evidence and partial Attestation Results to the subsequent Verifier.

   The process is repeated, until the entire appraisal is complete.  The
   last Verifier, i.e. Verifier-N, completes its Appraisal of the
   Component Attester Evidence and returns the complete Attestation
   Results to the N-1 Verifier, which passed Evidence to it.  The N-1
   Verifier then simply passes the Aggregated Attestation Results(AAR)
   from where it received its Combined Evidence.  Alternatively, it may
   also modify the AAR based on the inspection of received AAR.  For
   example, it may add its own Verifier Added Claims (policy claims) and
   produce a new AAR.  The process is repeated, until the Verifier,
   which recieved the initial Evidence is reached.  At this point in
   time the Aggregated Attestation Results are signed and the Aggregated
   Attestation Results are sent to the Attester (in Passport Model) or
   Relying Party (in background check model).

   As shown in the picture, the partial results and Combined Evidence is
   transmitted to a chain of Verifier, till the Appraisal is complete.
   The Verifier combines the incoming partial results, combines the
   results from it own Evidence Appraisal and passes the Aggregated
   Attestation Results to the Verifier from which it receives Combined
   Evidence.

4.2.1.  Trust Relationships

4.2.2.  Verifiers

   In the cascaded pattern, the communicating Verifiers fully trust each
   other.  Each Verifier has the trust anchor for the Verifier it is
   communicating to (i.e. either sending information or receiving
   information).  This prevents man in the middle attack for the partial
   Attestation Results received by a Verifier or a Aggregated
   Attestation Results (AAR) which it receives in the return path.

4.2.3.  Relying Party and Verifiers

   In the cascaded pattern, the RP may communicate with any Verifier and
   thus receive its Attestation Results.  Hence RP fully trusts all the
   Verifiers.

4.3.  Hybrid Pattern

   In a particular deployment, there is a possibility that the two
   models presented above can be combined to produce a hybrid pattern.
   For example Verifier 2 in the Cascaded Pattern becomes the Lead
   Verifier for the remaining Verifers from 3, to N.

5.  Freshness

   The Verifier needs to ensure that the claims included in the Evidence
   reflect the latest state of the Attester.  As per RATS Architecture,
   the recommended freshness is ascertained using either Synchronised
   Clocks, Epoch IDs, or nonce, embedded in the Evidence.  In the case
   of Hierarchical Pattern, the Verification of Freshness should be
   checked by the Lead Verifier.

   In the Cascaded Pattern, the freshness is always checked by the first
   Verifier in communication with either the Attester (Passport Model)
   or Relying Party (Background Check Model).
