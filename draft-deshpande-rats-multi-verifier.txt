               Remote Attestation with Multiple Verifiers
               draft-deshpande-rats-multi-verifier-latest

Abstract

   IETF RATS Architecture, defines the key role of a Verifier.  In a
   complex system, this role needs to be performed by multiple Verfiers
   coordinating together to assess the full trustworthiness of an
   Attester.  This document focuses on various topological patterns for
   a multiple Verifier system.  It only covers the architectural aspects
   introduced by the Multi Verifier concept, which is neutral with
   regard to specific wire formats, encoding, transport mechanisms, or
   processing details.

1.  Introduction

   A Verifier plays a central role in any Remote Attestation System.  A
   Verifier appraises the Attester and produces Attestation Results,
   which are essentially a verdict of attestation.  The results are
   consumed by the Relying Party to conclude the trustworthiness of the
   Attester, before making any critical decisions about the Attester,
   such as admitting it to the network or releasing confidential
   resources to it.  Attesters can come in wide varieties of shape and
   form.  For example Attesters can be endpoints (edge or IoT devices)
   or complex machines in the cloud.  Composite Attester Section 4.1,
   generate Evidence that consists of multiple parts.  For example, in
   data center servers, it is not uncommon for separate attesting
   environments (AE) to serve a subsection of the entire machine.  One
   AE might measure and attest to what was booted on the main CPU, while
   another AE might measure and attest to what was booted machine's GPU.
   Throughout this document we use the term Component Attester
   Section 4.1 to address the sub-entity or an individual layer which
   produces its own Evidence in a Composite Attester system.

   In a Composite Attester system, it may not be possible for a single
   Verifier to possess all the capabilities or information required to
   conduct a complete appraisal of the Attester.  Please refer to
   Section 2 for motivation of this document.  Multiple Verifiers need
   to collaborate to reach a conclusion on the appraisal and produce the
   Attestation Results.

   This document describes various topological patterns of multiple
   Verifiers that work in a coordinated manner to conduct appraisal of a
   Composite Attester to produce an Attestation Results.

2.  Need for Multiple Verifiers

   To conduct the task of Evidence appraisal, a Verifier requires:

   1.  Reference Values from trusted supply chain actors producing,
       aggregating, or administering Attesters (Reference Value
       Providers)

   2.  Endorsements from trusted supply chain actors producing,
       certifying, or compliance checking Attesters (Endorsers)

   3.  Appraisal Policy for Evidence, which is under the control of the
       Verifier Owner

   The Verifier inputs listed above are linked to the shape of the
   Attesters.  Typically, Composite Attesters come with a varying degree
   of heterogeneity of Evidence formats, depending on the type of
   Attesting Environments that come with each Component Attester, for
   example, CPU variants or GPU/FPGA variants.  When conducting Evidence
   appraisal for a Composite Attester, the following challenges remain:

   1.  An Attester's composition can change over time based on market
       requirements and availability (e.g., a set of racks in a data
       center gets thousands of new FPGAs).  It is highly unlikely that
       there is always one appropriate Verifier that satisfies all the
       requirements that a complex and changing Composite Attesters
       imposes.  It may not be economically viable to build and maintain
       such a degree of complexity in a single Verifier.

   2.  A Verifier Owner may have an Appraisal Policy for Evidence of a
       Component Attester that is internal to them and which they may
       choose not to reveal to a â€œmonolithic" Verifier.

   3.  A Reference Values Provider may not wish to reveal its Reference
       Values or their lifecycle to a monolithic Verifier.

   4.  There may not be a single actor in the ecosystem that can stand
       up and take ownership of verifying every Component Attester due
       to a lack of knowledge, complexity, regulations or associated
       cost.

   5.  The mix today is a combination of Verifier services provided by
       component manufacturers, Verifiers provided by integrators, and
       Verifiers under local authority (i.e., close to the attester).
       Rarely is it just one of these.

3.  Reference Use Cases

   This section covers generic use cases that demonstrate the
   applicability of Multi Verifier, regardless of specific solutions.
   Its purpose is to motivate various aspects of the architecture
   presented in this document.  There are many other use cases; this
   document does not contain a complete list.

3.1.  Verification of Devices containing heterogenous components

   A device may contain a central processing unit (CPU), as well as
   heterogeneous acceleration components (such as GPUs, NPUs and TPUs)
   from different suppliers.

   These components can be used to speed up processing or assist with AI
   inference.  Trustworthiness assessment of the device requires trust
   in all of these components.  However, due to business concerns such
   as scalability, complexity and cost of infrastructure, the Verifier
   for each type of component may be deployed separately by each vendor.

   When these Verifiers operate together, they must interact with each
   other, understand the topology and interoperate using standardised
   protocols.  For instance, they may need to exchange partial Evidence
   relating to the relevant component or partial Attestation Results for
   it.

   Attester: A Device having multiple components

   Relying Party: An entity which is making trust decisions for such an
   Attester

3.2.  Verification of Workloads operating in Confidential Computing
      environment

   As organisations move more workloads into untrusted or shared
   environments, Confidential Computing is becoming increasingly
   important.  In such a system, an application or workload (which could
   be an AI model, database process or financial service, for example)
   is executed inside a TEE-protected virtual machine (VM).  When the
   workload starts, the TEE can generate a cryptographic attestation
   report providing:

   1.  The workload is running on a platform with a known state.

   2.  The workload is running the correct application.

   The platform is often built by an independent TEE vendor, while the
   workloads are deployed by workload owners from different parts of the
   supply chain.

   Verification of Attestation for such a system requires independent,
   yet mutually coordinated, verification of: Platform claims appraised
   by a Platform Verifier and Workload claims appraised by a Workload
   Verifier.

   Attester: A layered Attester containing a platform and a workload
   running in a CC environment

   Relying Party: An entity which is making trust decisions, such as a
   key release to a workload

4.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses terms and concepts defined by the RATS
   architecture.  For a complete glossary, see Section 4 of [RFC9334].

   Specifically this document heavily uses the terms Layered Attester
   Section 3.2 of [RFC9334] and Composite Device Section 3.3 of
   [RFC9334]

4.1.  Glossary

   This document uses the following terms:

   Composite Attester:  A Composite Attester is either a Composite
      Device or a Layered Attester or any composition involving a
      combination of one or more Composite Devices or Layered Attesters.

   Component Attester:  A Component Attester is a single Attester of a
      Composite Attester.  For this document, a Component Attester is an
      entity which produces a single Evidence which can be appraised by
      a Component Verifier.

   Composite Evidence:  Evidence produced by a Composite Attester.  Also
      referred to as CE in the document.

   Lead Verifier:  A Verifier which acts as a main Verifier to receive
      Composite Evidence from a Composite Attester in a Hierarchical
      pattern Section 5.1.  Also referred to as LV in the document.

   Component Verifier:  A Verifier which is responsible for the
      Verification of one single component or a layer.  Also referred to
      as CV in the document.

   Partial Attestation Results:  Attestation Results produced by a
      Component Verifier, which contains partial results from atleast
      one or more Component Attesters.

   Aggregated Attestation Results:  An Aggregated Attestation Results
      (AAR) refers to a collection of Attestation Results produced upon
      completion of appraisal of a Composite Attester.

5.  Multi Verifier topological patterns

   A Composite Attester has multiple Component Attesters.  Each Attester
   requires a different set of Verifiers.  Hence multiple Verifiers
   collaborate to appraise a Composite Attester.

                                  +----------+

                    Figure 1: Hierarchical Pattern

   The following sub-sections describe the various roles that exist in
   this pattern.

5.1.1.  Lead Verifier

   In this topological pattern, there is an Entity known as Lead
   Verifier.

   Lead Verifier is the central entity in communication with the
   Attester (directly in passport model or indirectly via the Relying
   Party in background-check model).  It receives Attestation Evidence
   from a Composite Attester.  If the Composite Attestation Evidence is
   signed, then it validates the integrity of the Evidence by validating
   the signature.  If signature verification fails, the Verification is
   terminated.  Otherwise it performs the following steps.

   *  Lead Verifier has the knowledge about the overall structure of the
      Composite Evidence.  It decodes the Composite Evidence to extract
      the Component Attester Evidence.  This may lead to "N" Evidence,
      one for each Component Attester.

   *  Lead Verifier delegates each Component Attester Evidence to their
      own Verifier and receives Component Attester Attestation Results
      after successful Appraisal of Evidence.

   *  Once the Lead Verifier receives Attestation Results from all the
      Verifiers, it combines the results from each Verifier to construct
      a Aggregated Attestation Results (AAR).  The Lead verifier may
      apply its own policies and also add extra claims as part of its
      appraisal.

   *  Lead Verifier conveys the AAR to the Attester (in Passport model)
      or to the Relying Party (in background check model).

   The overall verdict may be dependent on the Appraisal Policy of the
   Lead Verifier.

   In certain topologies, it is possible that only the Composite
   Evidence is signed to provide the overall integrity, while the
   individual Component Attester Evidence (example Evidence 1) is not
   protected.  In such cases, the Lead Verifer upon processing of
   Composite Evidence may wrap the Component Attester Evidence (example
   Evidence 1) in a signed Conceptual Message Wrapper (CMW), and send it
   to each Verifier (example Verifier 1).

5.1.2.  Verifier for Component Attester

   The role of a Component Attester Verifier is to receive Component
   Attester Evidence from the lead Verifier and produce Attestation
   Results to the Lead Verifier.

5.1.3.  Trust Relationships

   In this topology the Lead Verifier is fully trusted by Component
   Attester Verifiers (example Verifier 1).

   Also, each of the Component Attester Verifier is fully trusted by the
   Lead Verifier.  Lead Verifier is provisioned with the Trust Anchors
   (see [RFC6024]) for Verifier 1..N.

5.2.  Cascaded Pattern

   Figure below shows the block diagram of a Cascaded Pattern.

                               +-----------+          +-----------+             +-----------+
+--------+                     |           |          |           |             |           |
|        |  Composite Evidence |           |  (CE)    |           |   (CE)      |           |
|        +-------------------->+           +--------->+           +------------>+           |
|        |     (CE)            |           |Partial AR|           | Partial AR  |           |
|Attester|                     | Verifier 1|          | Verifier 2|             | Verifier N|
|  or    |  Aggregated         |           |          |           |             |           |
| RP     +<--------------------+           +<---------+           +<------------+           |
+--------+ Attestation Results |           |  (AAR)   |           |  (AAR)      |           |
              (AAR)            |           |          |           |             |           |
                               +-----------+          +-----------+             +-----------+

                      Figure 2: Cascaded Pattern

   In this topological pattern, the Attestation Verification happens in
   sequence.  Verifiers are cascaded to perform the Attestation
   Appraisal.  Each Verifier in the chain possess the knowledge of the
   entire Composite Attester topology.

   Attester may send the Composite Evidence(CE) to any of the Verifier
   (directly in the passport model, or indirectly via the Relying Party
   in the background-check model).  The Verifier which processes the
   Composite Evidence, Verifies the signature on the Evidence, if
   present.  It decodes the Composite Evidence performs Appraisal of the
   Component Attester whose Reference Values and Endorsements are in its
   database.  Once the appraisal is complete, it forwards the Composite
   Evidence and partial Attestation Results to the subsequent Verifier.

   The process is repeated, until the entire appraisal is complete.  The
   last Verifier, i.e. Verifier-N, completes its Appraisal of the
   Component Attester Evidence and returns the complete Attestation
   Results to the N-1 Verifier, which passed Evidence to it.  The N-1
   Verifier then simply passes the Aggregated Attestation Results(AAR)
   from where it received its Combined Evidence.  Alternatively, it may
   also modify the AAR based on the inspection of received AAR.  For
   example, it may add its own Verifier Added Claims (policy claims) and
   produce a new AAR.  The process is repeated, until the Verifier,
   which recieved the initial Evidence is reached.  At this point in
   time the Aggregated Attestation Results are signed and the Aggregated
   Attestation Results are sent to the Attester (in Passport Model) or
   Relying Party (in background check model).

   As shown in the picture, the partial results and Combined Evidence is
   transmitted to a chain of Verifier, till the Appraisal is complete.
   The Verifier combines the incoming partial results, combines the
   results from it own Evidence Appraisal and passes the Aggregated
   Attestation Results to the Verifier from which it receives Combined
   Evidence.

5.2.1.  Trust Relationships

5.2.2.  Verifiers

   In the cascaded pattern, the communicating Verifiers fully trust each
   other.  Each Verifier has the trust anchor for the Verifier it is
   communicating to (i.e. either sending information or receiving
   information).  This prevents man in the middle attack for the partial
   Attestation Results received by a Verifier or a Aggregated
   Attestation Results (AAR) which it receives in the return path.

5.2.3.  Relying Party and Verifiers

   In the cascaded pattern, the RP may communicate with any Verifier and
   thus receive its Attestation Results.  Hence RP fully trusts all the
   Verifiers.

5.3.  Hybrid Pattern

   In a particular deployment, there is a possibility that the two
   models presented above can be combined to produce a hybrid pattern.
   For example Verifier 2 in the Cascaded Pattern becomes the Lead
   Verifier for the remaining Verifers from 3, to N.

6.  Freshness

   The Verifier needs to ensure that the claims included in the Evidence
   reflect the latest state of the Attester.  As per RATS Architecture,
   the recommended freshness is ascertained using either Synchronised
   Clocks, Epoch IDs, or nonce, embedded in the Evidence.  In the case
   of Hierarchical Pattern, the Verification of Freshness should be
   checked by the Lead Verifier.

   In the Cascaded Pattern, the freshness is always checked by the first
   Verifier in communication with either the Attester (Passport Model)
   or Relying Party (Background Check Model).

7.  Security Considerations

   The Verifier is effectively part of the Attesters' and Relying
   Parties' trusted computing base (TCB).  When multiple Verifiers
   coordinate to conduct appraisal, it leads to larger TCB and hence
   more attack surface.  Any mistake in the appraisal procedure
   conducted by one or more Verifiers could lead to severe security
   implications, such as incorrect Attestation Result of a component or
   a composition to the Relying party.  This section details the
   security threats and mitigation strategies specific to the multi-
   verifier topologies described in this document.  In addition to the
   considerations herein, Verifiers MUST follow the guidance detailed in
   the Security and Privacy considerations of a RATS Verifier as
   detailed in Section 11 of [I-D.draft-ietf-rats-corim] and the RATS
   Architecture Section 11 and Section 12 of [RFC9334].

7.1.  Adversarial Model

   The security analysis in this section assumes that attackers may:

   1.  Eavesdrop on any communication channel between Verifiers.

   2.  Inject, modify, replay, or delay messages traversing the network.

   3.  Compromise one or more Verifiers in the ecosystem, attempting to
       leak sensitive information (e.g., Evidence, Reference Values) or
       manipulate Attestation Results.

   4.  Perform Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks between any two
       communicating entities.

   The system is designed to be resilient under the assumption that the
   cryptographic keys used for signing Evidence and Attestation Results
   (by authentic entities) are not compromised.

7.2.  General Considerations

   All communications between entities (Attester-Verifier, Verifier-
   Verifier, Verifier-RP) MUST be secured using mutually authenticated,
   confidential, and integrity-protected channels (e.g., TLS).

7.3.  Security for Topological Patterns

7.3.1.  Hierarchical Pattern

   The hierarchical pattern introduces a central trust entity, the Lead
   Verifier (LV).  The security of the entire system relies on the
   integrity and correct operation of the LV.

7.3.1.1.  Threats and Mitigations

7.3.1.1.1.  LV Compromise

   *Threat:* A compromised LV can orchestrate attacks, such as approving
   malicious attestations, wrongly aggregating attestation results or
   leaking sensitive evidence.  This is a single point of failure from a
   trust perspective.

   *Mitigation:* The LV MUST be hardened and operate and store its Keys
   in a secure environment.  Its operation SHOULD be auditable.
   Component Verifiers should be made available suitable trust anchors
   so that they can establish required trust in the authority of the LV.

7.3.1.1.2.  Communication Security (LV <-> CV)

   *Threat:* Eavesdropping or manipulation of evidence/results in
   transit.

   *Mitigation:* All communications between the LV and CVs MUST be
   mutually authenticated and confidential (e.g., using TLS with client
   authentication).  This ensures integrity, confidentiality, and
   authenticity of the messages exchanged between the Verifiers.

7.3.1.1.3.  Evidence Integrity and Origin Authentication (LV -> CV)

   *Threat:* The LV could forward manipulated evidence to a CV, or an
   attacker could inject fake evidence.

   *Mitigation:* The conceptual message containing the Component
   Evidence MUST be integrity-protected and authenticated.  If the
   Component Evidence is natively signed by the Component Attester at
   origin, the CV can verify it directly.  If the Component Evidence
   lacks inherent signatures (e.g., in UCCS), the LV MUST sign the
   Component Evidence using a key that the CV trusts.  This prevents any
   on-path attacker from altering the Component Evidence.

7.3.1.1.4.  Results Integrity and Origin Authentication (CV -> LV)

   *Threat:* Partial Attestation Results could be manipulated in transit
   or forged by a malicious CV.

   *Mitigation:* Each Partial Attestation Result MUST be digitally
   signed by the CV.  LV should maintain a list of trust anchors for the
   CV's it communicates with.  The LV MUST validate the signature using
   the required trust anchor for the CV, before adding the Partial
   Attestation Results to the Aggregated Attestation Results.

7.3.1.1.5.  Replay Attacks

   *Threat:* An adversary Component Verifier replays old Evidence or
   Attestation Results.

   *Mitigation:* The LV is responsible for enforcing freshness (via
   nonces, epochs, or timestamps).  This freshness value MUST be
   propagated to CVs and back to the LV, to ensure final AR can be
   validated against the original challenge.

7.3.2.  Cascaded Pattern

   The cascaded pattern distributes trust but requires each Verifier in
   the chain to be trusted to correctly handle and forward Attestation
   messages.  The chain's security is only as strong as its weakest
   link.

7.3.2.1.  Threats and Mitigations

7.3.2.1.1.  Verifier Compromise

   *Threat:* Any compromised Verifier in the chain can block, delay, or
   manipulate the attestation process.  It can inject false partial
   results, drop evidence, or leak sensitive information.

   *Mitigation:* Relying Parties and Verifiers MUST be configured with
   strict trust policies defining the allowed paths and trusted
   Verifiers.  Operations should be logged for auditability.

7.3.2.1.2.  Communication Security

   *Threat:* Eavesdropping or manipulation of evidence and results
   between Verifiers.

   *Mitigation:* Each hop between Verifiers MUST be secured with
   mutually authenticated and confidential channels (e.g., TLS with
   client authentication).

7.3.2.1.3.  Evidence and Results Protection

   *Threat:* Lack of end-to-end security allows intermediate Verifiers
   to manipulate evidence or results that are not intended for them to
   appraise.

   *Mitigation:* End-to-end integrity protection is RECOMMENDED.  The
   Composite Evidence should be signed by the Attester.  Partial and
   Aggregated Attestation Results SHOULD be signed by the Verifier that
   generated them.  This allows subsequent Verifiers and the Relying
   Party to verify that results have not been tampered with by
   intermediate nodes.

7.3.2.1.4.  Replay Attacks

   *Threat:* An adversary replays old Evidence or Attestation Results.

   *Mitigation:* The first Verifier in the chain (the one receiving
   evidence from the Attester/RP) is responsible for enforcing freshness
   (via nonces, epochs, or timestamps) for the entire cascade.  This
   freshness value MUST be propagated with the Evidence and Results
   through the chain so the final AR can be validated against the
   original challenge.

7.3.3.  Security of the Hybrid Pattern

   As the hybrid pattern is the composition of hierarchical pattern and
   cascade pattern, all the threats and mitigations that are applicable
   for these two patterns are also applicable for the general hybrid
   pattern.

8.  Privacy Considerations

   The appraisal of a Composite Attester requires exchange of
   attestation related messages, for example, partial Evidence and
   partial Attestation Results, among multiple Verifiers.  This can
   potentially leak sensitive information about the Attester's
   configuration , identities and the nature of composition.

   *  Minimization: Attesters should only generate Evidence that is
      strictly necessary for the appraisal policy.  Verifiers should
      only request necessary claims.

   *  Confidentiality: Encryption should be used to prevent unauthorized
      parties (including other Verifiers in the hierarchy or cascade)
      from accessing sensitive Evidence.  This is crucial in multi-
      tenant environments.

   *  Policy Handling: Verifiers should be careful not to leak their
      internal appraisal policies (e.g., through error messages or
      timing side channels) when communicating with other Verifiers or
      Attesters, as this information could be exploited by an attacker
      to manipulate appraisal.
